	abstract = {Swarm Robotics is an emerging field of adapting the phenomenon of natural swarms to robotics. It is a study of robots that are aimed to mimic natural swarms, like ants and birds, to form a system that is scalable, flexible, and robust. These robots show self-organization, autonomy, cooperation, and coordination amongst themselves. The cost and design complexity factor is aimed to keep low, hence trying to form systems that are very much similar to natural swarms. The robots operate without any central entity to control them, and the communication amongst the robots can either be direct (robot-to-robot) or indirect (robot-to-environment). Swarm robotics has a wide range of application fields, from simple household tasks to military missions. This paper reviews the swarm robotics approach from its history to its future. It discusses the basic idea of swarm robotics, its important features, simulators, projects, real life applications and some future ideas.},

abstract="The health care sector is totally different from any other industry. It is a high priority sector and consumers expect the highest level of care and services regardless of cost. The health care sector has not achieved society's expectations, even though the sector consumes a huge percentage of national budgets. Mostly, the interpretations of medical data are analyzed by medical experts. In terms of a medical expert interpreting images, this is quite limited due to its subjectivity and the complexity of the images; extensive variations exist between experts and fatigue sets in due to their heavy workload. Following the success of deep learning in other real-world applications, it is seen as also providing exciting and accurate solutions for medical imaging, and is seen as a key method for future applications in the health care sector. In this chapter, we discuss state-of-the-art deep learning architecture and its optimization when used for medical image segmentation and classification. The chapter closes with a discussion of the challenges of deep learning methods with regard to medical imaging and open research issue.",

abstract="This paper introduces a deep reinforcement learning method to train an autonomous aerial agent acting as a shepherd to provide guidance for a swarm of ground vehicles. The learner is situated within a high-fidelity robotic-operating-system (ROS)-based simulation environment consisting of an Unmanned Aerial Vehicle (UAV) learning to guide a swarm of Unmanned Ground Vehicles (UGVs) to a target location. Our approach uses a combination of machine education, apprenticeship bootstrapping, and deep-learning-based methodologies to decompose the complex shepherding strategy into sub-problems requiring simpler skills that get fused to form the overall skills required for shepherding. The proposed methodology is effective in training the UAV agent with multiple reward designing schemes.",

abstract = {In several species of ants, workers cooperate to retrieve large prey. Usually, one ant finds a prey item, tries to move it, and when unsuccessful for some time, recruits nestmates through direct contact or chemical marking. When a group of ants tries to move large prey, the ants change position and alignment until the prey can be moved toward the nest. A robotic implementation of this phenomenon is described. Although the robotic system may not appear to be very efficient, it is an interesting example of decentralized problem-solving by a group of robots, and it provides the first formalized model of cooperative transport in ants.}

abstract = {A group of individual truckers can be regarded as a swarm intelligence system without central management. With the development of autonomous driving technology, trucker groups will be replaced by driverless vehicles. At that point, a swarm of truckers will become a swarm robotics system. Therefore, considering the design and control of an efficient swarm robotics system, it is essential to investigate the properties and model the behaviors of a swarm of truckers in advance. In this study, we probe the characteristics of both individual truckers and a swarm of truckers using trajectory data of truckers. First, the trajectory data were map matched based on the geographic scale of cities and administrative regions. Then, the properties of the division of labor, pattern formation, and swarm synchronization were obtained through an analysis of the spatiotemporal distribution of radius of gyration, travel distance, and the number of visited places. Because predicting the next visit locations of individuals of a swarm is a measure for modeling swarm behaviors, the prediction model can be used to predict future swarm robotics (driverless trucks) behaviors. Thus, we apply several machine learning models to predict the next locations of truckers. The results show that there are common characteristics and routines embodied in the behavior of the truckers; the swarm shows consistency and regularity. Moreover, the peak predictability of the entire group reached 94%, indicating that our model can predict the behavior of groups and individuals. Our findings provide basis supporting to the future efficient swarm robotics system.}
